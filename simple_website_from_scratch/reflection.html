			<h3>Thinking Rhetorically about Writing on the Web:</h3>
			<p>Right off the bat when I think about the blog posts that stand out to me the most, I think about one of Alaina Vaughn’s posts. Specifically, I think about her post titled “HASHTAG ACTIVISM: NO ONE REALLY CARES WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.” I had the pleasure of being in both of Alaina’s blog workshop groups, so I read both of her articles during the revision process and they were both great, but this one really carried some real weight and brought some insight into a topic I already had my own opinions about. The whole idea to me of being a social activist through social media seems strange to me. Seemingly overnight I saw many of my friends from high school suddenly become crusaders for a cause that I had never heard them speak out for before or participate in any other way than online. I am not saying that I do not support the causes they are supporting but I personally do not feel like it is my place to making post after post on social media about how I support these movements when I do not go out into the community and lend a hand to the cause. I like the way Alaina put it “The key is to become an actual warrior, and not just a keyboard warrior.” I think that post is important for people to read before they go out and start writing all their opinions out on the web for everyone to see.</p>
			<p>More recently, I read Ashi Franke’s article titled “Is Your “Aesthetic” Accessible?” I would like to start by saying I really like the way the whole post is laid out, and the inclusion of the jump to section option at the top is amazing. The reason I was drawn to this article is because I have developed over the past year or so a very specific aesthetic that I like to incorporate into my work and that is one of minimalism. I have, unfortunately, not put much thought into how that aesthetic may be confusing to some people. The example is given of adding names to icons to help the user know what that button or link is doing. It is a great idea but one that usually would not cross my mind immediately because being a technology focused person I recognize those icons and what they do. Accessibility is not just a convenience that we can offer the to the users of our site, it is a requirement and something that should really be taken seriously despite the aesthetic that we are trying to achieve. </p>
			
			<h3>Revision Process:</h3>
			<p>My revision process has always been the same for the most part, I even wrote my first blog post about the planning and prototyping steps of my workflow. Revising work that I have done helps to refine what I am trying to say and sometimes even bring a new way of looking at an idea that I had during my rough draft. I always try to keep an open mind when it comes to revision, especially when feedback from my peers is involved. It is helpful to not be too attached to the work that was done in the first revision if the final product and can be improved by changing or completely throwing out certain parts of the first draft. A rough draft is supposed to be just what it says, rough. It is just an opportunity for me to get my initial thoughts down on paper, now matter how long it is, knowing that it can be cut down and refined from there. I honestly cannot say that my revision process did not change too much over the course of the semester except for the fact that the rough drafts of both of my blogs were second revisions and not the initial rough draft, which I normally do not do. </p>
			
			<h3>Classmate Support:</h3>
			<p>In general, I feel like the support that I offer to my classmates is of the “positive reinforcement” variety. Meaning that I tend to reinforce what my classmates are doing well with little sprinkles of what they can change to help improve. The group that I was in for the HTML and CSS discussions had several web development focused students in it, so I felt that I was always a little late to the party with responding to the comments of my group members who had less experience. This was primarily due to my work schedule which leaves most of my time to do school related work after 9pm. I do feel like I had some helpful input, especially during the HTML brainstorm discussion I think I was able to help Ambria with her questions on where to find the images to link to for the page as well as how to create hyperlinks. </p>
			
			<h3>Challenges:</h3>
			<p>biggest challenge I faced in this course over the semester was with my blog post writing. I have never been known to be a good writer and have even been told that my “grammar sucks” by one of teachers back in high school. With that in mind I took the time to do my first revision on my blog posts before the rough drafts were due. Knowing that I would be getting feedback from my classmates I did not want to give them too much work to do, so I did one revision on my own. I think this helped a lot because getting rid of most of the grammatical and organizational issues with my writing helped my classmates focus more on the finer details of my posts. I think that helped my posts be as strong as I felt that they were.</p>
			
			<h3>Growth &amp; Goals:</h3>
			<p>I was in a unique situation coming into this semester because of the experience I have. I am a semi-non-traditional student and transferred into the web design and development program last fall with around 200 hours of undergraduate and graduate course work. Because of this I ended up taking a lot of courses out of order which means I came into this class already having experience with HTML and CSS and really wanting to focus on my writing ability. Specifically, I wanted to learn what is different between writing online versus other types of writing. I feel like I have improved a lot in my online writing. Before my writing all resembled the essay writing that I would have done in high school, but now I really feel like it flows a lot better. I feel as though I take better advantage of headers and sub headers, and that I do a better job organizing my content and splitting into smaller more easily digested chunks. I am a firm believer that there is always room for improvement in every aspect of life. I even included my two published blog posts in a web portfolio that I submitted for a front-end development internship before Thanksgiving. With the career path I am I will never stop writing on the web so the skills I acquired in this class will only help me continue to grow in my field. </p>
